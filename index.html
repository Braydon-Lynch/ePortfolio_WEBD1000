                <h3>About me!</h3>
                    Hello, my name is Braydon Lynch and I am studying IT Programming<br>
                here at the Nova Scotia Community College Institute of Technology.<br>
                Programming and website development are two technical skill areas that<br>
                I enjoy and I believe I am gaining strength in. Although I am still in<br>
                the early stages of my IT education, I am excited to build on my<br>
                knowledge of programming and website development, as well as other skills<br> 
                such as security, data management, and development of software for users<br> 
                to enjoy. I am a motivated learner, and can adapt to work in changing<br> 
                environments. I enjoy challenges and am eager to join a team of IT<br> 
                Professionals that can achieve great work in the IT industry. I am also an<br> 
                avid puzzle solver, and enjoy completing sudokus and other forms of brain<br> 
                stimulating games, which I believe helps me to problem solve codes that<br> 
                I've written. I also believe these puzzles make my codes better and<br> 
                operate at their best.
